Major policy decisions with significant financial impact, such as endowment spending rule changes, also require approval by the board. In advance of meetings all trustees receive background information about relevant strategic and operational issues and key questions they are asked to consider.

Yale University Secondary Navigation Main Navigation Breadcrumb Additional Navigation Sub Navigation Traditions & History Yale has grown and evolved for 300-plus years, passing many milestones and forging traditions along the way.  The university traces its roots to the 1640s when colonial clergymen led an effort to establish a local college to preserve the tradition of European liberal education in the New World. In 1701 the charter was granted for a school “wherein Youth may be instructed in the Arts and Sciences (and) through the blessing of Almighty God may be fitted for Publick employment both in Church and Civil State.” The school officially became Yale College in 1718, when it was renamed in honor of Welsh merchant Elihu Yale, who had donated the proceeds from the sale of nine bales of goods together with 417 books and a portrait of King George I. Take a stroll through Yale’s three centuries of history, and learn about the traditions that have become part of the fabric of our university. Landmarks in Yale’s History 1701 Yale is founded in nearby Saybrook, CT as the Collegiate School to educate students for “Publick employment both in Church and Civil State.” In the over 300 years since its founding, Yale has worked to educate those who would become leaders and contributors to every sector of society.  1716 The Collegiate School trustees vote to move to more hospitable New Haven, fulfilling the dream of one of New Haven’s founders, the Reverend John Davenport, to establish a college there.  1718 The Collegiate School is renamed Yale College in recognition of Elihu Yale’s donation of books and goods.  1732 The Reverend George Berkeley establishes the Berkeley Scholarships for graduate study, the first such scholarships in America. Today, Yale College admits all students without regard to their family’s financial circumstances. 1750 Construction is started on Connecticut Hall, now the oldest building in New Haven and a National Historic Landmark. In 1906 a major renovation restored the original gambrel roof.  1757 The first church within a college in America is founded at Yale. During Yale’s first two centuries, Yale graduates influenced the spread of Christianity by serving as missionaries throughout the world. 1767 Construction is completed on the Pierpont House, the oldest surviving house in New Haven. It was used as the Office of Undergraduate Admissions before becoming the Visitor Center in 1995. A thorough restoration was completed in 2002. 1776 Yale graduates become influential leaders in the American Revolution. Twenty-five Yale men served in the Continental Congress, and four Yale graduates signed the Declaration of Independence—Lyman Hall (B.A. 1747), Philip Livingston (B.A. 1737), Lewis Morris (B.A. 1746), and Oliver Wolcott (B.A. 1747). Other leading Yale patriots included Nathan Hale (B.A. 1773), Noah Webster (B.A. 1778), Joel Barlow (B.A. 1778), and Timothy Dwight (B.A. 1769).  1779 British troops invade New Haven, but the student militia rallies to help defend the city. Edmund Fanning, secretary to the British general and Yale graduate (B.A. 1757), persuades the British to leave New Haven without burning the city. 1792 John Trumbull, artist and one-time aide-de-camp to General Washington, develops the Brick Row campus plan, in collaboration with James Hillhouse (B.A. 1773), making Yale the first planned college campus in America. Their plan was well received in New Haven, America’s first planned city. 1802 Considered the father of modern scientific education in America, Benjamin Silliman, Sr. (B.A. 1796, faculty 1799–1853), teaches the first modern science course (chemistry) in the United States.  1813 Yale School of Medicine is founded as the “Medical Institution of Yale College.” The Yale System of Medical Education, which is based on the concept that medical students require guidance and stimulation rather than compulsion or competition, was introduced in 1931 and remains distinctive among medical schools. 1822 Yale Divinity School is founded as the “Theological Department.” Religious studies were central to a Yale education from the beginning. In 1746, the first professorship of divinity was created, and the education of all Yale undergraduates continued to be shaped throughout the nineteenth century by such earlier practices as daily chapel services.  1824 Yale Law School is founded. Consistently ranked as the preeminent law school in the country, it trains outstanding practitioners, jurists, judges, and government officials. The Yale Law School has fostered major movements in American law, including the law and economics movement, the law of outer space, and international human rights.  1832 Yale University Art Gallery opens, the first college art museum in the Western Hemisphere. Established with John Trumbull’s donation of his paintings, including his original series of Revolutionary War scenes, the collection now encompasses over 185,000 works of art from ancient Egypt to the present day.  1836 Yale Literary Magazine, the oldest literary review in the country, is founded. In the twentieth century, Yale emerged at the forefront of approaches to new ways of studying literature. These include New Criticism, comparative literature, and literary deconstruction.  1843 The first collegiate rowing races are held in New Haven Harbor. Other college sports firsts occurring at Yale include the first intercollegiate game of modern baseball (1865), the development of modern football (see 1880), and the first game of basketball played with five-man teams (1897).  1847 The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is founded as the “Department of Philosophy and the Arts,” offering seminars in chemistry and metallurgy, agricultural science, Greek and Latin literature, mathematics, philology, and Arabic. The Department is also the precursor of the Sheffield Scientific School and the School of Engineering, making it one of the first scientific schools in the U.S. 1854 Yung Wing is the first Chinese man to be awarded a degree (B.A.) from an American university.   1861 Yale becomes the first university in the U.S. to award Doctor of Philosophy degrees. Today, Yale awards Ph.D. degrees to students who have completed work in seventy-four departments and programs.   1866 The Peabody Museum of Natural History is established by the philanthropist George Peabody, uncle of Othniel C. Marsh (B.A. 1860), the nation’s first professor of paleontology. Yale’s earliest museum collection was begun in the eighteenth century and consisted of “natural and artificial curiosities” from around the world.  1869 The first university arts institution, the School of the Fine Arts, opens. Established through the generosity of Augustus Russell Street (B.A. 1812), it was the first Yale school open to women, who formed the majority of students in the School’s first four decades.  1876 Edward A. Bouchet, a New Haven native and graduate of the Yale College Class of 1874, is the first African American to earn a Ph.D. in America. His degree was the sixth doctorate in physics ever awarded in that field.  1878 Yale Daily News is founded, the oldest college daily newspaper. Many famous journalists developed their passion for journalism as reporters and editors on its staff.  1880 While an undergraduate, Walter Camp (B.A. 1880) develops the modern game of football from the rough game of rugby. Camp, now known as the father of American football, introduced the down, the eleven-man team, and the 100-yard field marked off in a gridiron.  1889 Yale students adopt Handsome Dan, a ferocious and enthusiastic fan at early football games. Handsome Dan inspired Cole Porter to write Yale’s famous fight song, “Bulldog, Bulldog.”  1894 Yale School of Music is established. Today, Yale is one of the most active musical campuses in the world, with more than 400 concerts offered each year by visiting performers as well as University faculty and students. The University sponsors numerous choral and instrumental groups, including two symphony orchestras.   1900 Yale’s Forestry School, now the School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, is established, the oldest in the country, and the only such school at an Ivy League institution. Gifford Pinchot (B.A. 1889), often referred to as the “Father of the U.S. Forest Service,” and his parents donated the funds to start the school.  1901 Yale commemorates its Bicentennial with ceremonies on campus and with gifts from alumni that supported the construction of University Commons, Woolsey Hall, and Memorial Hall (the Rotunda).  1909 A group of “gentleman songsters” begin gathering weekly at Mory’s and adopt the name Whiffenpoofs. Today, the Yale campus still rings with the sounds of the Whiffenpoofs as well as more than one dozen other organized a cappella singing groups. 1914 Yale Bowl is completed, the largest amphitheater built since the Roman Colosseum. Capacity of the Bowl was later expanded to hold 80,000 fans before being reduced to its present-day capacity of 64,000.  1915 One of the first academic programs in public health in the country is founded. The Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at the School of Medicine has played a pivotal role in addressing central public health issues. The department’s founders started a tradition of community outreach that continues today around the world through the work of faculty, students, and alumni. 1918 End of World War I. The First Yale Unit, formed in 1916, is considered to be the first naval air reserve unit and the first aerial coastal patrol unit. Lt. David Ingalls (B.A. 1920), a member of the First Yale Unit, flying a Sopwith Camel with the Royal Air Force, was the first naval aviator to become an ace.  1920 Yale students invent the Frisbee, tossing pie plates from the Frisbie Pie Company to each other and calling “Frisbie!” to warn passersby. The spelling was changed when Wham-O began mass-producing the saucers.  1921 Upon its completion, Harkness Memorial Tower is the tallest freestanding masonry tower in the United States. This icon of the University contains a beautiful 54-bell carillon that is played daily by student and professional carillonneurs.  1923 Yale School of Nursing is founded, succeeding the fifty-year-old Connecticut Training School. It was the first nursing school to have autonomy within a university and to be under university standards and influence rather than under hospital control.  1930 Sterling Memorial Library, designed by architect James Gamble Rogers (B.A. 1889), is completed. With many architectural features reminiscent of the great cathedrals of Europe, Sterling Library is well known for its numerous carvings, ironwork, and lead glass windows illustrating the history of books, writing, and Yale.  1932 Payne Whitney Gymnasium, one of the largest indoor athletic facilities in the world, is completed.  1933 First seven residential colleges are opened. The distinctive system for living and learning, based on the English model at Oxford and Cambridge, expanded to twelve residential colleges by 1963.  1935 Yale Institute of International Studies, the only research center of its kind in the world, is established. Organized within the Graduate School, it supported faculty research in foreign affairs and created the first interdisciplinary Ph.D. program at Yale. Today, the Whitney and Betty MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies is a focal point for encouraging interdisciplinary, international, and area-focused research and teaching.  1943 The Yale campus is transformed into a military training center, and laboratories are used to conduct research in support of the war effort. Captain Glenn Miller and his band’s weekly broadcasts from Woolsey Hall are heard by citizens and troops around the world.  1955 Yale School of Drama is founded, thirty-one years after the establishment of a Department of Drama in the School of the Fine Arts. The School offers M.F.A. and D.F.A. degrees and operates the Tony Award-winning Yale Repertory Theatre. 1963 The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library opens, devoted entirely to Yale’s exceptional collections of rare books and manuscripts. Designed by Gordon Bunshaft, the building is constructed of translucent marble panes framed in granite and enclosing a six-story freestanding book tower.  1969 Yale College admits women for the first time. Women have attended other schools at Yale since 1869, when the first women enrolled in the School of the Fine Arts.  1972 Yale School of Architecture is founded, fifty-six years after the establishment of a Department of Architecture in the School of the Fine Arts. The School’s faculty and alumni include leading U.S. and international practitioners responsible for some of the most important architecture and urbanism of our time.  1976 Yale School of Management is founded. SOM focuses on preparing men and women who will be leaders in their businesses, NGOs, entrepreneurial ventures, and communities. In addition to the Master of Business Administration degree (M.B.A.), students may pursue a joint degree with any of eight other Yale professional schools.  1977 Yale Center for British Art, which contains the most comprehensive collection of British art outside the United Kingdom, opens its doors. The Center and its ongoing programs were made possible by the generosity of Yale’s great philanthropist Paul Mellon (B.A. 1929).  2007 Yale's West Campus, located on 136 acres 7 miles west of downtown New Haven, is acquired. The facility includes over 400,000 square feet of research/lab space and includes office and warehouse space, in addition to a full-service child care center and a central utilities plant.  2011 The National University of Singapore (NUS) and Yale University announce that they will establish Yale-NUS College, an autonomous college of NUS. The College provides a new model of liberal arts education for Asia that will prepare high potential students — from Singapore, the rest of Asia and beyond — for leadership and engaged citizenship in today's complex and rapidly changing world. 2014 Construction begins on two new residential colleges, thanks in part to a $250 million gift commitment to the university by Charles B. Johnson, a 1954 graduate of Yale College. The colleges will be the first additions to the residential college system since 1961 and will allow Yale College to admit 200 more students per class. 2015 A $150 million path-breaking gift by Blackstone founder and Yale alumnus, Stephen A. Schwarzman ’69 B.A. will create a world-class, state-of-the-art campus center by renovating the historic Commons and Memorial Hall.  1701 Yale is founded in nearby Saybrook, CT as the Collegiate School to educate students for “Publick employment both in Church and Civil State.” In the over 300 years since its founding, Yale has worked to educate those who would become leaders and contributors to every sector of society.  1716 The Collegiate School trustees vote to move to more hospitable New Haven, fulfilling the dream of one of New Haven’s founders, the Reverend John Davenport, to establish a college there.  1718 The Collegiate School is renamed Yale College in recognition of Elihu Yale’s donation of books and goods.  1732 The Reverend George Berkeley establishes the Berkeley Scholarships for graduate study, the first such scholarships in America.

Yale Traditions The Commencement ceremony on Old Campus is our most joyous tradition, during which all university degrees are formally conferred. Handsome Dan became the Yale mascot in 1889 when student Andrew B. Graves saw the dog sitting in front of a shop and purchased him from a New Haven blacksmith for $5.  Class Day takes place on Old Campus on the Sunday before Commencement and includes the awarding of academic, artistic, and athletic prizes; the celebration of undergraduates; and an address by a notable speaker. Also, hats.  Yale began a new tradition in 2014 of a “Founders Day” event for students, faculty, and staff, to be held annually on a day close to the anniversary of the 1701 founding. Yale’s residential college system allows students to experience the cohesiveness and intimacy of a small school while still enjoying the cultural and scholarly resources of a large university. Each year, new students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences sign the register to celebrate the start of their graduate studies at Yale.  The Yale School of Medicine welcomes first-year students to a life in medicine during the annual White Coat Ceremony. Yale football games have been a tradition for Yalies since the mid-1800s; we celebrated 150 years of baseball in 2015; and Yale athletes have excelled around the world in the Olympics and other international competitions. Yale’s connections to the military have been long-standing, beginning in 1779 when past-president Naphtali Daggett led more than half of the student body to take on British troops when they attacked New Haven.

Yale University Secondary Navigation Main Navigation Breadcrumb By-Laws (As Approved by the Corporation, June 10, 2017) Yale’s Charter provides that its governing body, known legally as “The President and Fellows of Yale College” – or, more simply, as “The Corporation” – “shall have the government, care and management of the College … and make such reasonable laws … as they think fit and proper for the instruction and education of the students.” The Corporation comprises 19 members: Three members ex officiis: the President of the University and the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor of the State of Connecticut. Ten “Successors to the original Trustees”, who elect their own successors. Their terms on the Corporation are limited by their own vote to two six-year terms, except that upon recommendation of the President in special circumstances a Successor Trustee may be elected to an additional term of up to three years. Successor Trustees must retire on the June 30 following their attainment of the age of 72. Six Alumni Fellows* elected by the alumni as provided in the Miscellaneous Regulations. Alumni Fellows are elected one each year for a six-year term. Alumni Fellows must retire on the June 30 following their attainment of the age of 72. In addition to the President, the officers of the University are: a Provost, a Secretary, a Treasurer, a General Counsel and such other officers as the President may request and nominate and the Corporation may authorize and elect. The President may propose and the Corporation may authorize variants of these titles from time to time to reflect assigned responsibilities. *In 1792, by act of the General Assembly of Connecticut, the ten Successor Trustees were joined by eight Trustees ex-officiis: the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, and “six senior assistants in the Council of this State.” In 1819 the six senior assistants were replaced by the six senior State Senators. The attendance of the Senators at Corporation meetings was, however, perfunctory and unreliable. In 1871, therefore, the Legislature agreed to divest them of their membership and granted the Yale alumni the right to elect, instead, six of their own number. The President & Fellows 1. Regular meetings of the President and Fellows (Corporation), unless otherwise ordered, shall be held at least five times during each year as scheduled by the Corporation on recommendation of the President.

Meetings of the Corporation shall be opened with prayer. 2.
