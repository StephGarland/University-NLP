# [](#header-1)Project 1: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
### [](#header-3)This semester we had two project objectives:

The first was to further our understanding of Machine Learning techniques and theory. We aimed to increase our familiarity with concepts in the Data Science world (like Word Embeddings, and Neural Networks.) We also hoped to gain a more practical familiarity of the more widely used libraries (like TensorFlow and Gensim.)
In order to narrow our research field a little, Tom had a specific interest in Linguistics, so our lens was focused through Natural Language Processing examples. 

Our second objective was to make a thing in order to showcase (and drive) our exciting new knowledge base. At David’s suggestion, we decided to make word vectors for 50 of the top North American Universities. Then we could compare various analytics, like lexical diversity and semantic word meanings. 

### [](#header-3)My area of research was web scraping:

In general, web scraping involves visiting the desired page, extracting the specific information required, and then putting it in a format that will be helpful for later modelling. 
In our case, this meant visiting every single page on the website’s of our 50 universities, pulling any text, and generating a text/csv file per university. Each line in each file would represent all text from a single page.
